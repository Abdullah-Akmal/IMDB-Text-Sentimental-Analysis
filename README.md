# IMDB Text Sentiment Analysis

## Description  
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using IMDB movie reviews. The notebook leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify reviews as positive or negative. It includes text preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation.  
**[Dataset Source â€“ IMDB Reviews (Kaggle or TensorFlow Datasets)]**

## Objectives  
- Analyze IMDB movie review text data  
- Preprocess raw text using NLP techniques  
- Train models to classify sentiment as positive or negative  
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance  

## Methodology / Steps  
- Load and inspect the IMDB dataset  
- Clean and preprocess text (tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, etc.)  
- Convert text to numerical features using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF  
- Train classification models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or deep learning models  
- Evaluate with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Visualize word frequencies and sentiment distribution  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, LogisticRegression, classification_report, confusion_matrix, train_test_split), NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras (if used)
